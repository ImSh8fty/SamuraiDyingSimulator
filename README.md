# SamuraiDyingSimulator

This game is essentially what the title says. 

For this Unity project, you control a Samurai and you have a man with a gun across the screen. You only have two options, which are to dodge the bullets, or get hit by them. 

You are given three lives. You lose one when you get hit. Lose all 3 and the scene restarts. I've implemented some animations for both the samurai and the shooter. 

Samurai has idle and "get hit" animations, while the shooter also has idle and a shooting animation. When the shooting animation ends, a seperate bullet sprites appears using the trigger feature within the animation windows from Unity. A similar concept goes on with the bullet hitting the samurai to activate the "get hit" animation. The "get hit" animation is a little delayed perhaps, but for the sake of not losing my mind I decided to keep it as is. 

This will also be the base for the BIG 2D game project :)
